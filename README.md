# spotify_clustering

The ultimate aim of this project is to assist a friend in finding producers with an interest in the type of songs that he writes!

The API 'spotipy' allows a user to get data relating to songs, albums and playlists (among others), which can be found on the music streaming service Spotify. The data include information about a song's duration and the artist who created it, as well as the musical characteristics of the song through variables such as danceability and energy.

This project will use this API to cluster songs based on their musical characteristics. It serves as an opportunity to spend time learning about APIs and clustering algorithms.

### Spotipy API

Documentation for the spotipy API can be found here: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/

In order to use the API, one has to use a 'Spotify for Developers' account and set up an application which allows the user to obtain a client ID and a client secret - these codes act as credentials for using the API.
